#JASON CADY
###Web Designer & Web Developer in Oregon, USA

My interests range from web development to technology. I am also interested in music, dance, and Anime.

My interest in programming came from editing code in games that came with their code.... I also did a lot of hex editing single player games - both saved games and the running programs themselves... I even made my own Game Genie codes for the 16-bit Super Nintendo! I used to translate the implementation of mini versions of programming languages like SmallTalk & Scheme from one programming language to another. I am into the flexibility and freedom of dynamic languages that have a clean simple syntax & especially ones that also promote good engineering practices. I like to use Ruby, Coffeescript, Elixir, & Python. The languages that inspire me are Smalltalk, Lisp, Erlang, & Haskell.
